# HalfMesh
A Simple and flexible half edge data structure

This is my attempt at implementing a simple yet efficient half-edge data structure. It may not be perfect.
But i welcome any suggestions. There is no point in reinventing the wheel. I am just doing thing for educational purposes.
It might end up being something for more useful in future.

# Dependencies
C++11 

I will try to keep it free from clutter as much as possible and only depend on STL. But this may change in future.
