# HalfMesh
A Simple and flexible half edge data structure

This is a very simple Half Edge data structure implementation. It is currently only tailored for
triangular meshes. However, its quite straightforward to modify them for general polygonal surfaces.
Its quite easy to implement most of the surface algorithms such as
* Mesh subdivision
* Smoothing
* Hole detection
* Discrete curvature computation
* Feature edge detection

and so on..

# Notes
I will try to keep it free from clutter as much as possible and only depend on STL. 
But this may change in future. If you would like to see any specific geometry manipulation or
repair algorithm implemented, i would be more than happy to add it here in future. Just contact me.
